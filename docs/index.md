Quark is a modified version of the stock SD card package for the *TRIMUI Smart* handheld gaming device, originally created with the intention to trim (pun intended?) out the bloat from TRIMUI's official package as well as adding a multitude of extra goodies, such as additional systems, applications and ports.

* includes many more supported game systems, from additional home consoles and handhelds to home computers and ported games.
* has the latest emulator cores and optimised CPU profiles for the best balance between performance, emulator features and battery life
* supports network services including Syncthing, SSH, SFTP and HTTP file transfer!
