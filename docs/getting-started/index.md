# Getting started with Quark

You will need:

- A TrimUI Smart handheld updated to firmware v1.0.0 (`UI Version: 20240511`) or later
- A microSD card formatted with the FAT32 file system
!!! note
    It is not recommended to use the stock, unbranded (i.e. *64* label) microSD cards that are shipped with devices due to their failure rates. 
    
    Choose a microSD card from a reputable brand, known good ones are **SanDisk**, **Samsung** and **Lexar**.
- SD card formatting software
    - For Windows, use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie) or the SD Association's [SD Memory Card Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/sd-memory-card-formatter-for-windows-download/)
    - For macOS, use the built in Disk Utility tool or the `diskutil` command
    - For Linux, use the `mkfs.vfat` command.
- The latest release of Quark, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/cobaltgit/Quark/releases/latest)

See the *Installation* section for a complete guide to setting up your Smart and SD card for installing Quark.
