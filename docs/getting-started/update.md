# Updating Quark

Before updating Quark, you should have the following backed up on your microSD card:

* Your BIOS folder
* Your Roms folder
* Your Saves folder
* Any configuration overrides that you have made

!!! warning
    Some save states may become incompatible in the event of a RetroArch core update. Make sure to make in-game saves for your important games before updating!!

To update, first delete everything on your microSD card except the above listed folders.

Then, it's as simple as downloading the latest release [here](https://github.com/cobaltgit/Quark) and unzipping it over the root of your microSD card.

!!! tip
    Bug fix releases are also distributed as patch gluons, which can be placed into `SDCARD:/System/archives` to extract on boot. They require that the latest feature release is installed (i.e. updating from v1.1.0 to v1.1.1)
