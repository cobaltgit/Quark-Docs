# Frequently asked questions

## *My Smart is stuck at the boot screen and doesn't load into MainUI*

This is likely because your Smart is on an older firmware incompatible with Quark's app store-patched MainUI (i.e. **0.116alpha**)

Please ensure your Smart is updated to firmware **v1.0.0**, see the instructions [here](../getting-started/install.md)

## *How can I use L2 and R2 buttons?*

Enable *Menu + L/R -> L2/R2* in the Settings menu within MainUI.

MENU + L and MENU + R combos will respectively be mapped to L2 and R2 buttons.

## *My MP3s are playing slower/faster than they should*

Quark's built in MP3 player uses **44100Hz** as the sample rate. You'll need to make sure that the MP3s you are playing are of this sample rate - higher or lower sample rates (i.e. 48000Hz or 22050Hz) will cause your audio to be played slower or faster with pitch changes.
